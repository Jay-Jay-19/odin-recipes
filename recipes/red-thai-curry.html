    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Thai Chicken Curry is a healthy, one-pan dinner that’s dead simple to prepare and outrageously tasty. Ready in under an hour, this easy Thai curry recipe is fast enough for a weeknight but special enough for company</p>
    <p>If you can chop vegetables and stir coconut milk, you <em>can</em> make this easy Thai chicken curry recipe!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Chicken. You can make this Thai curry chicken with chicken breasts or swap it for chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Red Curry Paste. Thai red curry paste is the star flavor-maker in this Thai red chicken curry recipe. Curry paste is available in the Asian food section of most major grocery stores.</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk. While I’m all for a healthy swap, for this curry you need full-fat (not light) coconut milk or the sauce will be too watery.</li>
        <li>Bell Pepper. Loaded with vitamin A and vitamin C, tender red bell peppers add lovely flavor and color to this rich and robustly flavored Thai curry sauce.</li>
        <li>Leek. Provides the sauce with a mild onion flavor that lets the flavors of the curry paste really shine.</li>
        <li>Ginger and Garlic. Give this Thai curry sauce so much life.</li>
        <li>Cilantro. For a final herby finish that ties everything together.</li>
        <li>Rice. A bed of freshly steamed brown or jasmine rice is the perfect foundation for a healthy scoop of this creamy coconut Thai chicken curry recipe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Season the chicken and sear on both sides until golden. Transfer to a plate</li><br>

          <li>Sauté the vegetables and aromatics, then stir in the curry paste and let it bloom. Pour in the coconut milk.</li><br>

          <li>Return the chicken to the skillet, then bake the Thai curry at 375 degree F oven for 25 minutes, until cooked through. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice. Enjoy!</li><br>
        </ol>
