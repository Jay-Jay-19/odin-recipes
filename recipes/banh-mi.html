      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>In this recipe, I have made most ingredients in Vietnamese style so my banh mi will taste like the authentic banh mi you have tried in Vietnam including the roasted pork, pate, pickles, Vietnamese mayonnaise sauce, and even the  Vietnamese baguette- the soul of Banh mi Vietnam. In this post you will see what makes banh mi a great combination of different ingredients and flavours and why banh mi Vietnam has been consistently ranked as one of the world’s best sandwiches.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>4 loaves of Vietnamese baguette bread</li>
          <li>200gr sliced Vietnamese pork loaf (chả lụa), sliced</li>
          <li>80gr pâté</li>
          <li>200gr roasted pork, sliced</li>
          <li>200gr smoked ham/jambon, sliced</li>
          <li>pickled carrot and daikon</li>
          <li>mayonnaise</li>
          <li>1 Cucumber, sliced lengthwise</li>
          <li>Some green onions, sliced lengthwise</li>
          <li>Some fresh red chilli, sliced lengthwise</li>
          <li>Some cilantro, whole leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Cut a slit lengthwise of your bread, making sure the cut doesn’t go all the way through. Spread on some of the Vietnamese mayo and pate evenly across the bread.</li><br>

            <li>Carefully place your meat slices one at a time into the banh mi.</li><br>

            <li>Place your pickled daikon and carrots, then your vegetables.</li><br>

            <li>Drizzle about a tablespoon of your sauce all across the banh mi.</li>
          </ol>
